Hello
1. REST API for user management inside controllers/api folder - UserController
2. REST API for manage items for the bidding inside controllers/api folder - ItemController
3. REST API for make payments for an auction items. For that I have used stripe
4. Simple UI to handle auction

Also before you run the project please follow below guidelines:
* Extract the project and open the solution in visual studio
* Then open package manager console and run "update-database", it will generate a database in SQL server for the system
* Then you can create new users by using user POST request (You can import the postman json collection I'm sending as an attachment)
* Then you can create few items as well using Item POST request
* Then you can run the project and see

Thank you
